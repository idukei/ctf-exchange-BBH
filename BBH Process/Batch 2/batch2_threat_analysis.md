# Batch 2: Asset Operations & CTF Integration - Comprehensive Threat Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Batch Composition:** Asset Operations & CTF Integration (Mixin Dependency Layer)  
**Contracts:** AssetOperations.sol, Assets.sol, Registry.sol  
**Risk Score:** 20/25 (HIGH - Fund Loss via Infinite Minting)  
**Total Properties:** 101 (87 CRITICAL, 14 HIGH)  
**Primary Attack Surface:** External CTF calls, token registration logic, balance tracking

---

## 1. Contextual Mapping

### Batch Role Analysis
**Domain:** Core asset management layer - acts as abstraction between Trading logic and external ConditionalTokens contract

**Architecture Position:**
- **Mixin Layer**: Inherited by CTFExchange via multiple inheritance
- **Critical Path**: Trading._matchOrders() → AssetOperations._mint/_merge() → ConditionalTokens.splitPosition/mergePositions
- **Trust Boundary**: Interface between trusted internal contracts and untrusted external CTF

**Domain-Specific Threats:**
1. **CTF Integration Risks**: Reentrancy, unexpected reverts, gas griefing during external calls
2. **Token ID Complexity**: Binary outcome tokens with complement relationships - misconfiguration leads to infinite minting
3. **Balance Accounting**: Contract holds collateral AND CTF tokens - double-entry accounting errors possible
4. **Registry Manipulation**: Operator-controlled registration - incorrect complement mappings break MINT/MERGE logic
5. **Partition Array Hardcoding**: Fixed [1,2] partition assumes binary outcomes - broken if CTF behavior changes

### Key Invariants at Risk
- **ASO-INV-02 (CRITICAL)**: Contract never holds more collateral than sum of pending operations
- **REG-INV-01 (CRITICAL)**: Registry mapping cannot have circular complement references  
- **REG-INV-02 (CRITICAL)**: Once registered, token-complement pair immutable
- **AST-INV-01/02 (CRITICAL)**: Collateral and CTF addresses never zero after construction

---

## 2. Function-Level Threat Analysis

### 2.1 AssetOperations._mint(bytes32 conditionId, uint256 amount)

**Purpose:** Converts collateral → complementary CTF tokens via ConditionalTokens.splitPosition

**Execution Flow:**
```
_mint(conditionId, amount)
  ├── Create partition [1, 2]
  ├── External call: CTF.splitPosition(collateral, parentCollectionId=0x0, conditionId, partition, amount)
  └── Post-state: collateral -amount, token0 +amount, token1 +amount
```

#### Threat Scenarios (10 Total)

| # | Threat | Attack Vector | Path | Impact | Property Violated |
|---|--------|---------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| M1 | **Infinite Minting via Invalid ConditionId** | Attacker calls matchOrders with unregistered conditionId. If Registry validation bypassed, CTF.splitPosition succeeds but tokens untradeable. Repeat to drain collateral. | Registry bypass → _mint(invalid_id) → CTF creates orphan tokens | **CRITICAL** - Full collateral drain | ASO-FS-19, INT-FS-05 |
| M2 | **Reentrancy via CTF Callback** | If ConditionalTokens has callback (e.g., onERC1155Received), attacker re-enters _mint before balance update. Double-spend collateral. | _mint → CTF.splitPosition → callback → re-enter _mint | **CRITICAL** - Double collateral usage | INT-FS-04, ASO-INV-02 |
| M3 | **Gas Griefing via Revert** | Attacker front-runs with transaction causing CTF.splitPosition to revert (e.g., paused state). User's matchOrders tx fails, wasting gas. | _mint → CTF reverts → entire trade fails | **MEDIUM** - DoS, gas waste | INT-FS-01 |
| M4 | **Balance Mismatch via Irregular Collateral** | Use fee-on-transfer token as collateral. CTF receives less than `amount`, but contract expects full balance increase. | Collateral transfer -fee → CTF.splitPosition uses reduced amount → balance mismatch | **HIGH** - Accounting error, frozen funds | ASO-FS-21 |
| M5 | **Partition Manipulation** | If partition array [1,2] changeable via storage manipulation, attacker uses [1,3] to create non-complementary tokens. | Modified partition → CTF creates incompatible tokens → MERGE fails | **HIGH** - Funds stuck, unmergeable | ASO-FS-23 |
| M6 | **Zero Amount Exploit** | Attacker calls _mint with amount=0 to bypass checks, potentially manipulating state without balance change. | amount=0 → no collateral spent → CTF state change? | **LOW** - Logic error | ASO-FS-20 |
| M7 | **ConditionId Collision** | Two markets with similar conditions hash to same conditionId. Attacker mints tokens for Market A using Market B's collateral. | collisionId → _mint creates tokens for wrong market | **CRITICAL** - Cross-market fund theft | ASO-FS-19 |
| M8 | **Collateral Approval Race** | Assets.sol gives max approval to CTF in constructor. If CTF compromised after deployment, attacker drains all collateral via direct CTF call. | Compromised CTF → transferFrom(exchange, attacker, maxUint256) | **CRITICAL** - Total collateral loss | AST-CS-03 |
| M9 | **ParentCollectionId != 0 Attack** | Attacker front-runs to change parentCollectionId from bytes32(0). _mint uses wrong collection, creating incompatible tokens. | parentCollectionId modified → _mint creates tokens in wrong collection | **HIGH** - Incompatible tokens | ASO-FS-24 |
| M10 | **Flash Loan Attack** | Borrow large collateral, call _mint to get CTF tokens, sell tokens in same tx, repay loan. Profit from price manipulation during mint. | Flash loan → _mint → sell tokens → price impact → profit | **MEDIUM** - Economic exploit, market manipulation | Economic invariant |

**Role-Play (Low Funds Attacker):**
"I have 10 USDC. I notice Registry._registerToken is operator-only. I create market via UmaCtfAdapter with malicious conditionId that hashes to existing market's ID. When operator registers tokens, my fake market shares same conditionId. I call matchOrders with tiny MINT, system mints tokens for wrong market. I now hold tokens that can be merged with legitimate market's tokens, draining collateral."

**What-If Chain:**
- What if CTF.splitPosition is paused? → All MINT orders fail → trading halted
- What if collateral is USDT (no return value)? → TransferHelper fails → no mints possible
- What if conditionId is bytes32(0)? → CTF might create invalid tokens → broken market

---

### 2.2 AssetOperations._merge(bytes32 conditionId, uint256 amount)

**Purpose:** Converts complementary CTF tokens → collateral via ConditionalTokens.mergePositions

**Execution Flow:**
```
_merge(conditionId, amount)
  ├── Create partition [1, 2]
  ├── Check contract holds token0 >= amount AND token1 >= amount
  ├── External call: CTF.mergePositions(collateral, parentCollectionId=0x0, conditionId, partition, amount)
  └── Post-state: token0 -amount, token1 -amount, collateral +amount
```

#### Threat Scenarios (10 Total)

| # | Threat | Attack Vector | Path | Impact | Property Violated |
|---|--------|---------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| MG1 | **Incomplete Set Merge** | Attacker holds only token0, manipulates check to call _merge. CTF.mergePositions reverts, but if check bypassed, steals collateral without burning token1. | Bypass token1 balance check → _merge → collateral received, token1 not burned | **CRITICAL** - Collateral theft | ASO-FS-31, ASO-AS-04/05 |
| MG2 | **Reentrancy via CTF Burn** | CTF.mergePositions calls onERC1155Received for burned tokens. Attacker re-enters _merge to double-claim collateral. | _merge → CTF callback → re-enter _merge → double collateral | **CRITICAL** - Double collateral claim | INT-FS-04 |
| MG3 | **Collateral Transfer Failure** | After burning CTF tokens, CTF's transfer of collateral back to contract fails silently (if ERC20 non-standard). Tokens burned, no collateral received. | Token burn succeeds → collateral transfer silent fail → funds lost | **CRITICAL** - Permanent fund loss | ASO-FS-28 |
| MG4 | **Non-Complementary Token Merge** | Registry corrupted - token0 and token1 not true complements. _merge burns mismatched tokens, CTF reverts or creates invalid state. | Registry corruption → validateComplement bypassed → _merge with wrong tokens | **HIGH** - Broken merge, stuck tokens | INT-FS-07 |
| MG5 | **Griefing via Dust Amounts** | Attacker registers market, immediately calls _merge with amount=1 wei. Repeated micro-merges inflate gas costs for legitimate users by fragmenting balances. | Repeated _merge(1 wei) → high gas usage → DoS | **LOW** - Economic grief | ASO-FS-27 |
| MG6 | **Partition Mismatch Attack** | If _mint uses [1,2] but _merge somehow uses [2,1], CTF interprets as different token ordering. Merge fails or burns wrong tokens. | Partition order changed → _merge burns incorrect tokens | **CRITICAL** - Wrong tokens burned | ASO-FS-30 |
| MG7 | **Balance Check TOCTOU** | Attacker front-runs _merge after balance check passes. Transfers tokens away before CTF.mergePositions executes. CTF call reverts but state partially updated. | Balance check passes → front-run token transfer → CTF reverts → inconsistent state | **MEDIUM** - Inconsistent state | ASO-AS-04/05 |
| MG8 | **Collateral Inflation Attack** | _merge succeeds, collateral received. Attacker immediately calls _mint with same conditionId in one tx. Net zero token change but manipulates intermediate state for arbitrage. | _merge → collateral +X → _mint → collateral -X → arbitrage state between | **HIGH** - State manipulation arbitrage | Economic invariant |
| MG9 | **Invalid ParentCollectionId** | Similar to M9 but for merge. If parentCollectionId != 0, _merge attempts to merge tokens from wrong collection, burning valid tokens for no collateral. | Wrong parentCollectionId → merge burns tokens from wrong collection → no collateral | **CRITICAL** - Token burn with no refund | ASO-FS-32 |
| MG10 | **CTF Balance Desync** | CTF contract is upgraded (proxy) with bug. After _merge, CTF balance update fails but collateral still transferred. Contract loses CTF tokens permanently. | CTF upgrade bug → mergePositions collateral transfer succeeds → CTF balance not updated → desync | **HIGH** - Balance desynchronization | INT-FS-03 |

**Economic Incentive Example:**
"Market resolves in 5 blocks. I hold complementary tokens worth $100. I call _merge to get $100 USDC. If I can front-run resolution and merge before reportPayouts, I get collateral at face value instead of payout value. Profit = $100 - actual_payout."

---

### 2.3 AssetOperations._transfer(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 value)

**Purpose:** Unified transfer function - routes to ERC20 (collateral) or ERC1155 (CTF tokens)

**Execution Flow:**
```
_transfer(from, to, id, value)
  ├── if id == 0: _transferCollateral(from, to, value)
  │   └── if from == this: ERC20.transfer(to, value)
  │       else: ERC20.transferFrom(from, to, value)
  └── else: _transferCTF(from, to, id, value)
      └── ERC1155.safeTransferFrom(from, to, id, value)
```

#### Threat Scenarios (8 Total)

| # | Threat | Attack Vector | Path | Impact | Property Violated |
|---|--------|---------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| T1 | **ID Confusion Attack** | Attacker crafts order with id=0 when intending CTF transfer. System transfers collateral instead, draining contract balance. | Malformed order id=0 → _transfer calls _transferCollateral → wrong asset moved | **CRITICAL** - Wrong asset transferred | ASO-FS-04/05 |
| T2 | **Self-Transfer Griefing** | Attacker sets from=to=self. _transfer succeeds with no state change but emits events. Spam events to confuse monitoring systems. | from==to → transfer no-op → event spam | **LOW** - Event pollution | ASO-FS-06 |
| T3 | **Zero-Value Transfer Exploit** | Call _transfer with value=0. If no revert, attacker triggers unlimited events/logs to inflate block size or manipulate indexers. | value=0 → transfer emits event with 0 amount → log spam | **LOW** - Log manipulation | ASO-FS-10/18 |
| T4 | **ERC20 Return Value Ignored** | If collateral is USDT (no bool return), TransferHelper might not catch failures. Silent failure leaves sender balance unchanged, receiver expects funds. | USDT transfer fails silently → balance mismatch → accounting error | **HIGH** - Balance desync | ASO-FS-08/09 |
| T5 | **Reentrancy via ERC1155 Callback** | CTF tokens implement onERC1155Received callback. Attacker re-enters _transfer during callback to manipulate state mid-transfer. | _transferCTF → callback → re-enter _transfer → state manipulation | **HIGH** - Reentrancy | ASO-FS-15 |
| T6 | **Collateral Address Change Exploit** | If Assets.collateral is not truly immutable (storage collision, proxy upgrade), attacker changes to malicious ERC20. _transfer drains real funds to fake token. | Collateral address modified → _transfer sends to wrong token → fund loss | **CRITICAL** - Collateral substitution | AST-INV-01 |
| T7 | **From/To Confusion** | Attacker crafts transaction where from != msg.sender but approvals manipulated. _transferCollateral calls transferFrom with attacker-controlled addresses, stealing funds. | from != msg.sender, approval manipulation → transferFrom(victim, attacker) → theft | **CRITICAL** - Unauthorized transfer | ASO-FS-12 |
| T8 | **CTF Token ID Validation Bypass** | _transferCTF doesn't validate tokenId registered. Attacker transfers unregistered/invalid tokens, polluting contract with worthless assets. | Unregistered tokenId → _transferCTF succeeds → contract holds invalid tokens | **MEDIUM** - Asset pollution | ASO-FS-17 |

**Lateral Thinking:**
"What if attacker registers tokenId=0 as CTF token in Registry? Now id=0 is ambiguous - is it collateral or registered CTF? _transfer might route incorrectly, treating collateral as CTF or vice versa."

---

### 2.4 AssetOperations._getBalance(uint256 tokenId)

**Purpose:** Query contract's balance of collateral (id=0) or CTF token (id!=0)

**Execution Flow:**
```
_getBalance(tokenId)
  ├── if tokenId == 0: return ERC20(collateral).balanceOf(this)
  └── else: return ERC1155(ctf).balanceOf(this, tokenId)
```

#### Threat Scenarios (5 Total)

| # | Threat | Attack Vector | Path | Impact | Property Violated |
|---|--------|---------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| G1 | **Balance Oracle Manipulation** | If _getBalance used in critical logic, attacker flash-loans funds, inflates balance, manipulates dependent calculations, repays in same tx. | Flash loan → _getBalance returns inflated value → logic manipulated → profit | **HIGH** - Logic manipulation | ASO-INV-02 |
| G2 | **Reentrancy Balance Check** | Attacker re-enters during CTF callback, calls function using _getBalance. Balance still reflects pre-transfer state, bypassing checks. | Transfer initiated → callback → re-enter → _getBalance returns stale value → check bypassed | **MEDIUM** - Stale balance read | ASO-FS-03 |
| G3 | **TokenId=0 Collision** | Attacker registers tokenId=0 as CTF token. _getBalance(0) returns collateral balance, but system expects CTF token balance. | Registry allows tokenId=0 → _getBalance ambiguous → wrong balance returned | **HIGH** - Balance confusion | ASO-FS-01/02 |
| G4 | **Negative Balance Underflow** | If ERC20/ERC1155 implementation buggy, balance could underflow to MAX_UINT256. _getBalance returns huge value, breaking invariants. | Buggy token underflow → balanceOf returns MAX_UINT256 → invariant broken | **HIGH** - Invariant violation | ASO-FS-03 |
| G5 | **External Contract Revert** | If collateral or CTF contract malicious, balanceOf() reverts. _getBalance propagates revert, DoS all functions using balance checks. | Malicious token → balanceOf reverts → _getBalance reverts → DoS | **MEDIUM** - DoS via external dependency | INT-FS-01/02 |

---

### 2.5 Registry._registerToken(uint256 token0, uint256 token1, bytes32 conditionId)

**Purpose:** Operator-only registration of complementary token pair and parent conditionId

**Execution Flow:**
```
_registerToken(token0, token1, conditionId)
  ├── Require token0 != token1
  ├── Require token0 != 0 && token1 != 0
  ├── Require registry[token0].conditionId == 0 (not yet registered)
  ├── registry[token0] = OutcomeToken(token1, conditionId)
  ├── registry[token1] = OutcomeToken(token0, conditionId)
  └── Emit TokenRegistered events
```

#### Threat Scenarios (10 Total)

| # | Threat | Attack Vector | Path | Impact | Property Violated |
|---|--------|---------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| R1 | **Complement Mismatch** | Malicious operator registers token0→token1 but token1→token2 (not token0). Breaking complement symmetry allows partial minting/merging, draining collateral. | token0.complement=token1, token1.complement=token2 → asymmetric pair → exploit merge | **CRITICAL** - Infinite collateral drain | REG-INV-01, REG-FS-07 |
| R2 | **ConditionId Reuse** | Operator registers multiple token pairs with same conditionId. Cross-market merges possible, using tokens from Market A to merge in Market B. | token0_A and token0_B both use conditionId_X → cross-market merge → theft | **CRITICAL** - Cross-market fund theft | REG-FS-03 |
| R3 | **TokenId=0 Registration** | Operator accidentally registers token0=0 or token1=0. Breaks collateral/CTF distinction in _transfer and _getBalance. | token0=0 registered → collateral confused with CTF → wrong asset handled | **CRITICAL** - Asset type confusion | REG-FS-02 |
| R4 | **Self-Complement** | Operator sets token0==token1. _merge would burn same token twice (if check bypassed), or create circular dependency. | token0.complement=token0 → self-merge → double burn or DoS | **HIGH** - Invalid market structure | REG-FS-01 |
| R5 | **ConditionId Zero** | Operator sets conditionId=bytes32(0). _mint/_merge use zero conditionId, potentially creating invalid CTF state or global tokens. | conditionId=0 → CTF behavior undefined → broken market | **HIGH** - Invalid market | REG-FS-04 |
| R6 | **Re-registration Attack** | Operator mistakenly calls _registerToken twice for same token. If check fails, old registration overwritten, orphaning existing tokens. | Second registration → registry[token0] overwritten → old tokens invalid | **HIGH** - Orphaned tokens | REG-FS-05, REG-INV-02 |
| R7 | **Griefing via Max TokenIds** | Operator registers 2^256 token pairs, exhausting storage. High gas costs make future registrations prohibitive, DoS new markets. | Register excessive pairs → storage bloat → gas costs prohibitive → DoS | **LOW** - Economic DoS | Economic invariant |
| R8 | **ConditionId Collision** | Two UmaCtfAdapter markets hash to same conditionId (hash collision). Operator registers both, creating market confusion and cross-contamination. | Hash collision → same conditionId used twice → market confusion | **CRITICAL** - Market contamination | REG-FS-06 |
| R9 | **Operator Front-Running** | Operator sees profitable market about to launch, front-runs with registration of slightly modified tokens pointing to wrong conditionId. | Front-run registration → users mint wrong tokens → funds stuck | **HIGH** - Fund trapping | REG-FS-08 |
| R10 | **Complement Validation Bypass** | If validateComplement check removable via proxy upgrade, attacker trades non-complementary tokens, breaking merge logic. | Bypass validation → trade incompatible tokens → merge fails → stuck funds | **CRITICAL** - Broken market logic | REG-FS-09/10 |

**Centralization Threat:**
"Operator is single point of failure. If operator key compromised, attacker registers malicious markets with invalid complements or reused conditionIds. Entire exchange becomes vulnerable to cross-market exploits. No on-chain validation of operator inputs."

---

### 2.6 Registry.validateComplement(uint256 token, uint256 complement)

**Purpose:** Verify two tokens form valid complementary pair

**Threat Scenarios (3 Total):**

| # | Threat | Attack Vector | Path | Impact | Property Violated |
|---|--------|---------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| VC1 | **Validation Bypass via Gas Limit** | Attacker crafts transaction with gas limit just below revert threshold. validateComplement runs out of gas mid-check, appears to pass via fallback logic. | Low gas limit → validateComplement OOG → bypass | **HIGH** - Validation bypass | REG-FS-09 |
| VC2 | **Unregistered Token Validation** | If token not registered (conditionId=0), validation might pass incorrectly or revert unclearly. Attacker uses to trade unregistered tokens. | Unregistered token → validateComplement behavior undefined → trade invalid tokens | **MEDIUM** - Invalid tokens traded | REG-FS-10 |
| VC3 | **Circular Complement** | Registry has bug allowing token0→token1→token2→token0 circular chain. validateComplement infinite loops, DoS. | Circular registry → validateComplement infinite loop → DoS | **HIGH** - DoS | REG-INV-01 |

---

### 2.7 Registry.validateTokenId(uint256 tokenId)

**Purpose:** Ensure tokenId is registered

**Threat Scenarios (2 Total):**

| # | Threat | Attack Vector | Path | Impact | Property Violated |
|---|--------|---------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| VT1 | **Zero TokenId Bypass** | If validation doesn't explicitly check tokenId!=0, attacker trades with tokenId=0, treated as unregistered but passes check. | tokenId=0 → validation passes incorrectly → invalid trade | **MEDIUM** - Invalid token acceptance | REG-FS-11/12 |
| VT2 | **Unregistered Token Trade** | Attacker finds bypass where validateTokenId not called in certain paths. Trades unregistered tokens, causing downstream failures. | Validation skipped → unregistered token traded → merge/mint fails | **HIGH** - Market failure | REG-FS-12 |

---

### 2.8 Assets Constructor & Immutables

**Purpose:** Set collateral and CTF addresses, approve CTF for max collateral

**Threat Scenarios (5 Total):**

| # | Threat | Attack Vector | Path | Impact | Property Violated |
|---|--------|---------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| A1 | **Zero Address Deployment** | Deployer mistakenly passes address(0) for collateral or CTF. Constructor validation missing, contract deployed in broken state. | Deploy with 0 address → constructor doesn't revert → broken contract | **CRITICAL** - Unusable contract | AST-CS-01/02 |
| A2 | **Max Approval Exploit** | Attacker deploys malicious CTF contract, gets it whitelisted. During constructor, exchange gives max approval. CTF drains all collateral immediately. | Malicious CTF → max approval → transferFrom(exchange, attacker, MAX) → total loss | **CRITICAL** - Full collateral drain | AST-CS-03 |
| A3 | **Collateral/CTF Same Address** | Deployer sets collateral=CTF. _transfer routing breaks, collateral confused with CTF tokens. | collateral==CTF → _transfer logic broken → asset confusion | **CRITICAL** - Asset type confusion | AST-INV-03 |
| A4 | **Proxy Pattern Collision** | If Assets uses proxy pattern, storage collision between immutable addresses and proxy storage. Attacker manipulates to change addresses. | Storage collision → address modified → substitution attack | **CRITICAL** - Address manipulation | AST-INV-03 |
| A5 | **Approval Race Condition** | Between constructor giving approval and first use, attacker front-runs to exploit approval (if CTF malicious from start). | Constructor approval → front-run → transferFrom before first legitimate use | **HIGH** - Early attack window | AST-CS-03 |

## 3. Path-Level Exploration

### 3.1 Success Path: Normal MINT Operation

```
User Calls matchOrders(MINT)
  ├── Trading._matchOrders validates orders
  ├── Determines MINT match type
  ├── Calls AssetOperations._mint(conditionId, amount)
  │   ├── Creates partition [1, 2]
  │   ├── CTF.splitPosition(collateral, 0x0, conditionId, [1,2], amount) ✓
  │   │   ├── CTF checks: collateral approved ✓
  │   │   ├── CTF checks: contract has collateral balance ✓
  │   │   ├── CTF transferFrom(exchange, ctf, amount) ✓
  │   │   ├── CTF mints token0 (amount) to exchange ✓
  │   │   └── CTF mints token1 (amount) to exchange ✓
  │   └── Returns to Trading
  ├── Trading transfers tokens to users
  └── Success
```

**Property Validation Points:**
- ASO-FS-19: conditionId != 0
- ASO-FS-20: amount > 0
- ASO-FS-21: collateral balance decreases by amount
- ASO-FS-22: token0 and token1 balances each increase by amount
- INT-FS-01: splitPosition doesn't revert

### 3.2 Failure Path: Invalid ConditionId

```
Attacker Calls matchOrders(MINT with unregistered conditionId)
  ├── Trading._matchOrders validates orders (if bypass Registry check)
  ├── Calls AssetOperations._mint(invalid_conditionId, amount)
  │   ├── CTF.splitPosition(collateral, 0x0, invalid_conditionId, [1,2], amount)
  │   │   ├── CTF creates NEW condition (unintended) ⚠️
  │   │   ├── CTF mints token0_invalid, token1_invalid to exchange ⚠️
  │   │   └── Collateral transferred to CTF ✓
  │   └── Returns to Trading
  ├── Trading transfers invalid tokens to users
  └── Result: Collateral spent, invalid tokens created, no way to merge ❌
```

**Vulnerability:** If Registry validation bypassed, _mint succeeds with invalid conditionId, creating orphaned tokens.

**Property Violated:** INT-FS-05 (Tokens must be registered before mint)

### 3.3 Failure Path: Reentrancy During MERGE

```
Attacker's Malicious CTF Token with Callback
  ├── matchOrders(MERGE with malicious tokenId)
  ├── Trading._matchOrders
  ├── AssetOperations._merge(conditionId, amount)
  │   ├── Balance checks pass ✓
  │   ├── CTF.mergePositions(...) 
  │   │   ├── CTF calls onERC1155Received(attacker) 🚨
  │   │   │   └── Attacker's callback: re-enters _merge(same conditionId) 🔄
  │   │   │       ├── Balance checks STILL PASS (not yet updated) ⚠️
  │   │   │       ├── CTF.mergePositions(...) again
  │   │   │       └── Collateral transferred to exchange again ⚠️
  │   │   └── Original merge completes
  │   └── Result: Double collateral received for single token burn ❌
```

**Vulnerability:** No reentrancy guard on _merge. CTF callback allows re-entry before balance updates.

**Property Violated:** INT-FS-04 (No reentrancy during CTF calls)

---

## 4. Cross-Contract & Off-Chain Threats

### 4.1 Dependency Failures

| Dependency | Failure Scenario | Impact on Batch 2 | Mitigation |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| ConditionalTokens | Upgraded with bug in splitPosition/mergePositions | All MINT/MERGE fail, trading halted | **HIGH** - Monitor CTF upgrades, timelock changes |
| ConditionalTokens | Paused by admin | All CTF operations revert | **MEDIUM** - Implement circuit breaker in exchange |
| TransferHelper | SafeERC20 library vulnerability | Collateral transfers fail or exploitable | **HIGH** - Use latest OpenZeppelin, audit thoroughly |
| Trading Mixin | Validation bypass in _matchOrders | Invalid mints/merges reach AssetOperations | **CRITICAL** - AssetOperations must validate inputs independently |
| Registry Mixin | Corrupted via operator mistake | Wrong complements, stuck funds | **HIGH** - Multi-sig operator, immutable after registration |

### 4.2 Off-Chain Attack Vectors

**Operator Manipulation:**
- Threat: Malicious operator registers tokens with wrong conditionId or complements
- Attack: Front-run market launch, register incorrect mapping, trap user funds when merge fails
- Impact: HIGH - Funds stuck until manual intervention
- Defense: Multi-sig operator, on-chain conditionId verification against UmaCtfAdapter

**Front-Running:**
- Threat: MEV bot observes pending _registerToken, front-runs to register fake tokens first
- Attack: Real registration fails (duplicate), market launch delayed or broken
- Impact: MEDIUM - DoS, market disruption
- Defense: Private mempool for operator transactions, batch registration

**Oracle Manipulation (Indirect):**
- Threat: UmaCtfAdapter dispute manipulates market state, affecting which tokens considered valid
- Attack: Dispute resolved incorrectly, _mint/_merge use wrong tokens, accounting breaks
- Impact: HIGH - Cross-contamination between disputed and valid markets
- Defense: Pause trading during disputes, separate dispute resolution from token operations

**Social Engineering:**
- Threat: Attacker tricks operator into registering malicious market
- Attack: Operator unknowingly registers token pair controlled by attacker, embedding backdoor
- Impact: CRITICAL - Attacker controls market state
- Defense: Operator verification process, automated conditionId verification against public UMA data

## 6. Priority Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Pre-Launch)

**1. Implement Reentrancy Guards (CRITICAL - M2, MG2, T5)**
```solidity
// Add to AssetOperations
uint256 private _status = 1;
modifier nonReentrant() {
    require(_status == 1, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");
    _status = 2;
    _;
    _status = 1;
}

function _mint(...) internal nonReentrant { ... }
function _merge(...) internal nonReentrant { ... }
function _transfer(...) internal nonReentrant { ... }
```

**2. Add Input Validation to AssetOperations (CRITICAL - M1, MG1)**
```solidity
function _mint(bytes32 conditionId, uint256 amount) internal {
    require(conditionId != bytes32(0), "Invalid conditionId");
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be > 0");
    // Registry check BEFORE CTF call
    require(isConditionIdRegistered(conditionId), "ConditionId not registered");
    // ... rest of function
}
```

**3. Enhance Registry Validation (CRITICAL - R1, R2, R3)**
```solidity
function _registerToken(...) internal {
    require(token0 != 0 && token1 != 0, "Zero token");
    require(token0 != token1, "Self-complement");
    require(conditionId != bytes32(0), "Zero conditionId");
    
    // Check not already registered
    require(registry[token0].conditionId == 0, "Already registered");
    require(registry[token1].conditionId == 0, "Already registered");
    
    // Symmetry check
    registry[token0] = OutcomeToken(token1, conditionId);
    registry[token1] = OutcomeToken(token0, conditionId);
    
    // CRITICAL: Verify symmetry immediately
    assert(registry[token0].complement == token1);
    assert(registry[token1].complement == token0);
}
```

**4. Use SafeERC20 for All Transfers (HIGH - T4, MG3)**
```solidity
import {SafeERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";
using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

function _transferCollateral(...) internal {
    IERC20(getCollateral()).safeTransfer(to, value); // instead of transfer
}
```

### Medium-Term Improvements

**5. Circuit Breaker for CTF Dependencies (MEDIUM - M3, G5)**
- Implement pausable trading if CTF calls consistently fail
- Add fallback mechanism for CTF unavailability

**6. Multi-Sig Operator Requirements (HIGH - R1, R9)**
- Require 3-of-5 multi-sig for all _registerToken calls
- Implement timelock for registration (24hr delay)
- Add on-chain verification of conditionId against UmaCtfAdapter

**7. Balance Consistency Checks (HIGH - M4, MG10)**
```solidity
function _mint(...) internal {
    uint256 collateralBefore = _getBalance(0);
    uint256 token0Before = _getBalance(token0Id);
    
    // CTF call
    IConditionalTokens(getCtf()).splitPosition(...);
    
    // Post-call invariant checks
    require(_getBalance(0) == collateralBefore - amount, "Collateral mismatch");
    require(_getBalance(token0Id) == token0Before + amount, "Token0 mismatch");
}
```

### Monitoring & Alerting

**8. On-Chain Monitoring**
- Alert on any _mint/_merge with unregistered conditionId
- Monitor for balance mismatches between contract and CTF
- Track Registry changes and verify complement symmetry
- Alert on unusual patterns (repeated small merges, zero-value transfers)

**9. Off-Chain Monitoring**
- Track operator actions for suspicious registration patterns  
- Monitor for front-running of _registerToken
- Correlate UmaCtfAdapter disputes with trading activity
- Alert on abnormal collateral/CTF balance ratios

---

## 7. Additional Attack Scenarios for Consideration

**Scenario A: Cross-Batch Exploit via Trading Integration**
If Trading._matchOrders doesn't properly validate Registry state before calling _mint/_merge, attacker crafts orders exploiting stale Registry data. Between order signature and execution, operator updates Registry. _mint uses old conditionId, creating orphaned tokens.

**Scenario B: Upgrade Attack**
If CTFExchange uses upgradeable proxy pattern, malicious admin upgrades AssetOperations with backdoor allowing direct _mint without collateral transfer. All formal verification bypassed.

**Scenario C: Gas Token Exploitation**
Attacker uses GST2/CHI tokens to manipulate gas costs of _mint/_merge operations. During high gas periods, legitimate users can't execute trades, but attacker pre-loaded gas tokens to execute profitable trades.

**Scenario D: Collateral Drain via Complementary Markets**
Attacker creates two markets A and B with cleverly chosen conditions. Through specific sequence of mints/merges across both markets, extracts more collateral than deposited. Requires deep analysis of CTF's positionId calculation logic.

**Scenario E: Oracle-Asset Race Condition**
UmaCtfAdapter resolves market while _merge transaction in mempool. _merge completes with pre-resolution tokens but receives post-resolution collateral value. Arbitrage between pre/post resolution states.

## 8. Verification Strategy

### Formal Verification Priorities
1. **INT-FS-04**: No reentrancy during CTF calls → Use Certora Prover with CEX analysis
2. **ASO-INV-02**: Collateral accounting invariant → Continuous monitoring with assertion checks
3. **REG-INV-01**: No circular complements → Graph theory verification (DFS cycle detection)
4. **ASO-FS-21, ASO-FS-28**: Balance conservation → Property-based testing with Echidna

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: 100% coverage of all threat scenarios, especially edge cases (zero values, max uint, etc.)
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end MINT/MERGE with actual CTF contract on testnet
3. **Fuzzing**: Echidna campaigns targeting balance invariants and reentrancy
4. **Symbolic Execution**: Manticore analysis of all external call sites
5. **Static Analysis**: Slither, Mythril, Semgrep rules for identified threat patterns

### Auditor Focus Areas
- **Cross-contract state consistency** between Registry and AssetOperations
- **External call safety** in all CTF interactions
- **Operator privilege abuse** scenarios in Registry
- **Balance accounting** edge cases (underflow, overflow, reentrancy)
- **Path coverage** ensuring all validation branches tested

---

## Conclusion

**Batch 2 represents HIGH RISK** due to external CTF dependency and operator privileges. Primary concerns:

1. **Infinite minting** if Registry validation bypassed (M1, R1-R3)
2. **Reentrancy** during CTF callbacks (M2, MG2, T5)
3. **Balance manipulation** via fee-on-transfer tokens or CTF bugs (M4, MG10)
4. **Operator centralization** allowing malicious registrations (R1, R9)

**Critical properties (87) must be verified** before mainnet deployment. Recommend:
- Full Scribble annotation + Certora formal verification
- Extensive integration testing with mainnet CTF fork
- Multi-sig + timelock for all operator functions
- Comprehensive monitoring for balance invariants

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement immediate actions (reentrancy guards, input validation)
2. Deploy to testnet with full monitoring suite
3. Conduct security audit focused on identified threat scenarios
4. Simulate all 60 threat scenarios in controlled environment

**Estimated Risk Reduction:**
- With recommendations implemented: HIGH → MEDIUM-LOW
- Without recommendations: CRITICAL (unacceptable for mainnet)

**Would you like me to:**
1. **Prioritize specific threat scenarios** for immediate remediation?
2. **Deep-dive into any particular threat** (e.g., M1 infinite minting) with PoC code?
3. **Generate Echidna property tests** for identified threats?
4. **Proceed to Batch 3** (UMA Oracle Integration) threat analysis?
